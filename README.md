# DIY Redesign

The compiled site can be found in the `_deploy` folder. The source files are located in the `_build` folder.

## Compiling the site

In terminal, `cd` to project root.

To build HTML, compile CSS and run a local dev server, use command `jekyll serve --watch`.
This will look for changes, rebuild and allow you to preview the site at `localhost:4000`.
